# NP Problem Solvers in Python

This repository contains basic Python implementations of well-known NP problems, including the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** and the **0/1 Knapsack Problem**. The focus is on educational clarity and running simple test cases through a `main.py` file.

---

## Contents

- `TSP.py` – Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem with a simple brute-force approach.
- `backpack.py` – Solves the 0/1 Knapsack Problem using basic recursion or dynamic programming.
- `main.py` – Runs both solvers with sample inputs.

## What Are NP Problems?

NP problems (nondeterministic polynomial time) are a class of computational problems that are difficult to solve efficiently but easy to verify. This repo serves as a lightweight playground to explore how these problems behave when implemented in Python.
